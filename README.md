# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis:
  - The purpose of this analysis is to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School due to academic dishonesty, repeat the analysis we did previously in the module and see how the changes affected the overall analysis.
## Results:
  - Affect on district summary:
     - By subtracting the number of students in 9th grade at Thomas High School, the count for total students changes. But it only affect sightly on the average score and percentage value since one small change for one high school will not affect a lot in the sum of all schools.

  - Affect after replacing the ninth-grade scores:
     - Math and reading scores by grade are not affected for all schools except for Thomas High School
     - Scores by school spending are not affected for all schools except for Thomas High School
     - Scores by school size are not affected for all schools except for Thomas High School
     - Scores by school type are not affected for all schools except for Thomas High School
## Summary:
  - When the ninth grade reading and math scores at Thomas High School are replaced with NaNs, the total number of student doesn't change. Thus the average, percentage passing and overall passing value drops dramatically. (Numerator decrease and denominator stays the same).
  - After excluding 9th grade at Thomas High School, the scores for Thomas High School go back again. With only a slight difference from the outputs we get in the module.
